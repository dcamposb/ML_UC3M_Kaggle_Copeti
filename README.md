### Brief: 
Here I compare different algorithms' acurracies when predicting over an obscure data provided by our professor. I created a training pipeline and a scoring pipeline, alongside a hyperparamter tunning pipeline that allows for flexibility and scalability in small Data Science projects. I also comment a lot about my thought processes and justify certain steps and improvements needed for the future. 

This code has some data exploration, feature reduction, model comparisons and visualiations. Bare minimuns  when doing a DS project of this type. I might be updating the notebook if anything comes to mind. 

### Information about the Project (Context & Credit)
This is a notebook detailing the code used for a Kaggle Competition I participated in 2019. The competition was created by our Machine Learning professor: Dr. Pablo Martinez Olmos (a professor for the Masters in Big Data Analytics at Universidad Carllos III in Madrid). We worked in pairs to present a submission to the Kaggle Competition. 

In the original submission I ranked above 80% in the 70 competitor pool. I am revisiting the code and **updating it for my github repository**. I am also making changes as I see fit, to improve the code with things I have learned since then. Yolanda Iba√±ez Perez was my original partner in this competition, credit goes to her for the work presented here.
